                        Catering is the business of providing food and beverage services for events such as weddings, parties, corporate
                        functions, and other special occasions. Caterers are responsible for preparing, delivering, and serving food and
                        drinks to guests at the event. They may also be responsible for providing decorations, tables, chairs, linens,
                        and other equipment needed to set up the event.

                        Catering services can range from simple, casual affairs to elaborate, formal events with multiple courses and
                        service styles. Caterers may offer a variety of menus to choose from, or they may work with clients to create a
                        customized menu based on their preferences and dietary restrictions

                        Wedding decoration is the art of designing and setting up the aesthetic elements of a wedding ceremony and
                        reception to create a visually stunning and memorable event. Wedding decorations typically include floral
                        arrangements, centerpieces, lighting, linens, furniture, signage, and other decorative elements that reflect the
                        couple's style and personality.
                        <br/><br/>Wedding decoration: <br/>
                            Wedding decoration is an essential part of the wedding planning process and requires careful attention to detail
                            and coordination with other aspects of the event, such as the venue, catering, and entertainment. Wedding
                            decorators work closely with the couple to understand their vision and create a cohesive design that brings
                            their ideas to life.

                            Some popular wedding decoration styles include romantic and whimsical, rustic and vintage, modern and
                            minimalist, and glamorous and elegant. Decorators may use a variety of materials and techniques to create a
                            specific ambiance or theme, such as candles, lanterns, drapery, and floral installations.
